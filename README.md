# project-one: Brew Pin

This app makes use of two APIs: Google Maps and BreweryDB. 

Confirm you are 21 by clicking 'Yes Enter Site'. Then allow Google to use your location (required for map functionality.) Then simply enter a zip code and hit Find Breweries. The map will pan to that spot on the map and drop a pin for each brewery location in the zip code you entered.
